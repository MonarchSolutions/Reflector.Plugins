# Reflector Plugins

Porting some classic Reflector plugins to Reflector 10+, since there are some changes on Reflector's interfaces.

## Reflector.FePy
Decompile plugin for IronPython language. Ported from https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=ipreflector .

## License
We are just doing some porting job and do not own the copyright of the original plugins. Do not use these code for any commercial usages.

If you are the author of these plugins and do not like what we're doing, send me an email and I will remove your plugins' code.
